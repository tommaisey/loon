# loon

`loon` is a test library for the Lua programming language, with the following goals:

- Small: only two files (one of them is the `serpent` pretty-printing library), ~600 loc
- Simple and attractive API, with no globals
- Beautiful output
- Tests assertion failures don't halt the test

There are of course several other Lua test libraries, I simply wanted one with this
set of goals and trade-offs.
